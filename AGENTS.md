# 🤖 AI Agent Instructions for Hoverkraft-Tech Organization

This document provides global instructions and guidelines for AI agents working on projects within the hoverkraft-tech organization. All agents should follow these principles to ensure consistency, quality, and alignment with our organizational values.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. **SOLID Principles**
Apply SOLID principles consistently across all code:
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: Each class/module should have one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed Principle: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle: Many specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 2. **Clean Code Practices**
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful names
- Keep functions small and focused (ideally < 20 lines)
- Use consistent naming conventions appropriate to the language
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)
- Remove dead code and commented-out code
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use early returns to reduce complexity

### 3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
- Extract common logic into reusable functions/modules
- Create shared utilities for repeated patterns
- Use configuration over duplication
- Leverage existing libraries instead of reimplementing functionality

### 4. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
- Build only what is required now
- Avoid speculative generality
- Don't add functionality for potential future needs
- Keep solutions simple and focused

### 5. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
- Prefer simple, straightforward solutions
- Avoid over-engineering
- Choose clarity over cleverness
- Minimize cognitive load for future developers

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### Documentation as a First-Class Citizen
Documentation is critical for developer experience and should be treated with the same importance as code.

#### Documentation Priorities
1. **User-facing documentation** (README, API docs, guides)
2. **Code comments** (only when necessary to explain "why", not "what")
3. **Architecture decision records** (ADRs) for significant decisions
4. **Inline documentation** for complex algorithms or business logic

#### Documentation Best Practices
- **Avoid Duplication**: Single source of truth for each piece of information
- **Keep It Updated**: Update docs in the same PR as code changes
- **Be Concise**: Write clearly and avoid unnecessary verbosity
- **Include Examples**: Provide practical, working examples
- **Target the Audience**: Write for developers who will use or maintain the code

#### README Requirements
Every project must have a comprehensive README.md with:
- Clear project description
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Configuration options
- Contributing guidelines
- License information

#### Code Documentation
- Document public APIs thoroughly
- Explain complex business logic
- Document non-obvious design decisions
- Include examples for non-trivial usage
- Avoid stating the obvious (e.g., `// increment i` is noise)

## 🛠️ Technology Selection Guidelines

### Evaluation Criteria
When selecting dependencies, tools, or technologies, prioritize:

1. **Up-to-Date**: Actively maintained with recent updates
2. **Widely Used**: Strong community adoption and support
3. **Well Maintained**: Regular releases, responsive maintainers, good issue management
4. **Performant**: Proven performance characteristics
5. **Secure**: Good security track record, timely security updates
6. **Compatible**: Works well with our existing stack
7. **Documented**: Quality documentation and examples

### Technology Stack Alignment
Prefer technologies that align with our core stack:
- **Languages**: TypeScript, Go, Python
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, ArgoCD
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

### Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies up-to-date with automated tools (Dependabot, Renovate)
- Regularly audit for security vulnerabilities
- Minimize dependency count (fewer dependencies = less maintenance)
- Avoid dependencies with heavy transitive dependency trees
- Prefer stable, mature libraries over bleeding-edge alternatives
- Document why each major dependency was chosen

## 💻 Development Best Practices

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Use strong typing (TypeScript over JavaScript, typed Python)
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors explicitly, don't silently fail
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with appropriate levels
- **Testing**: Write tests before or alongside code (TDD/BDD)
- **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed before merging
- **Linting**: Use and enforce linters/formatters (ESLint, Prettier, Black, golangci-lint)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test critical user flows (where applicable)
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for >80% coverage, but prioritize meaningful tests
- **Test Quality**: Tests should be readable, maintainable, and fast
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Isolate tests from external services

### Version Control
- **Commit Messages**: Follow Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches from main, short-lived branches
- **Pull Requests**: Clear description, link to issues, include testing evidence
- **Small Changes**: Keep PRs focused and reviewable (< 400 lines ideal)

### Security
- **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables or secret management
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **Least Privilege**: Apply minimum necessary permissions
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies
- **HTTPS/TLS**: Always use encrypted connections
- **Security Headers**: Implement appropriate security headers for web applications

### Performance
- **Optimize for Common Cases**: Focus on hot paths
- **Measure Before Optimizing**: Use profiling tools
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategically
- **Async Operations**: Use asynchronous patterns for I/O operations
- **Resource Management**: Clean up resources properly (connections, files, etc.)

## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### Clean Architecture
- Separate concerns into layers (presentation, business logic, data)
- Dependencies point inward (business logic doesn't depend on frameworks)
- Use dependency injection for flexibility and testability
- Define clear boundaries between modules/packages

### Cloud-Native Design
- **12-Factor App**: Follow 12-factor app methodology
- **Stateless Services**: Design stateless, horizontally scalable services
- **Configuration**: Externalize configuration
- **Health Checks**: Implement liveness and readiness probes
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handle termination signals properly
- **Observability**: Expose metrics, logs, and traces

### API Design
- **RESTful Principles**: Follow REST conventions for HTTP APIs
- **Versioning**: Version APIs from the start (v1, v2)
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent naming and patterns
- **Error Responses**: Return meaningful, structured error messages
- **Documentation**: Use OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for public APIs

---

## 🚀 CI/CD and DevOps

### Continuous Integration
- **Automated Testing**: Run all tests on every commit
- **Build Validation**: Ensure code compiles/builds successfully
- **Linting**: Enforce code style and quality checks
- **Security Scanning**: Scan for vulnerabilities automatically
- **Fast Feedback**: Keep CI pipelines fast (< 10 minutes ideal)

### Continuous Deployment
- **Automated Deployments**: Deploy automatically after successful builds
- **Environment Parity**: Keep dev, staging, and prod as similar as possible
- **Blue-Green/Canary**: Use safe deployment strategies
- **Rollback Plan**: Always have a rollback strategy
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage infrastructure with Terraform

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics**: Expose application and business metrics
- **Logging**: Implement structured, searchable logging
- **Tracing**: Use distributed tracing for complex systems
- **Alerts**: Set up meaningful alerts for critical issues
- **Dashboards**: Create dashboards for system health visibility
